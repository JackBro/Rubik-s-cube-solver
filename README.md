# Rubik's cube solver based based on pattern databases and IDA star

## How to compile 

*  Compile the program using the `make` command. This creates "pdb" and main".

## How to run

*  Run `./pdb` if you are gonna create the pattern databases for the first time.
*  Run `./main` when you already ran "pdb" and want to solve a random instance
   of a Rubik's cube configuration.
