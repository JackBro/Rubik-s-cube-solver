Rubik's cube solver based based on pattern databases and IDA star

How to compile: 
    *Compile the program using the "make" command. This creates "pdb" and "main".
    *Run "pdb" if you are gonna create the pattern databases for the first time.
    *Run "main" when you already ran "pdb" and want to solve a random instance
        of a Rubik's cube configuration.

How to generate experimentos.pdf:
    *Run "pdflatex experimentos.tex; pdflatex experimentos.tex" (twice) to create
        the .pdf file with the experiments.
